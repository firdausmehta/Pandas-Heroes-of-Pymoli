## Background
After a lot of hard work in the data wrangling mines, I have been assigned the task of analysing the data for a new fantasy game, Heroes of Pymoli.
Like many others in its genre, the game is free-to-play, but players are encouraged to purchase optional items that enhance their playing experience. I have generated a report that breaks down the game's purchasing data into meaningful insights.

My final report includes each of the following:

### Player Count
